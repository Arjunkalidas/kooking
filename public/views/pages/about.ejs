                        A teaspoon of crushed seeds adds a superb flavor to pastry mixes, ice cream,
                        custards, and fruity sweet dishes (remove before serving).  Also great in
                        tea, coffee, and mulled wine.
                        Medicinal Uses: Cooling to the body, for bad breath, bronchitis, asthma,
                        incontinency, as an aphrodisiac, and in digestive disorders, like indigestion,
                        gas, cramps, helps make other herbs palatable.

                        In place of pepper with rice, stuffed vegetables, relishes, cordials,
                        liqueurs, roasts and mixed with yogurt. Medicinal Uses: Similar to caraway
                        and anise, relieves flatulence and bloating, and stimulates digestion,
                        relaxes the gut, useful for insomnia, colds and fevers.  Also stimulates
                        milk flow. Tips For Cooking and Storing: To enhance the flavor, roast whole
                        cumin seeds and then grind them with a mortar and pestle.  The pleasant
                        aroma will fill your kitchen.

                        Arjun, I’m the voice, author, and creator behind kooKING.
                        What started as a casual hobby for nights and weekends while I was
                        working as an fourth grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!)
                        that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month.

                        <br>
                        I live in Charlotte, with my dog Rambo. My favorite things in life are a
                        big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to the dog park.

                        In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, (mostly) healthy recipes
                        that I love to make and eat in my real, actual, every day life. If I wouldn’t
                        eat it in real life, I won’t put in on the blog. My goal is to inspire you
                        with food that is both approachable AND exciting, whether you’re cooking for
                        yourself, your family, your roommates, or your friends. I want you to be so
                        excited about these recipes that you eagerly await 5pm when you can go home from
                        work and start cooking.
